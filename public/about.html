    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Below are some of my hobbies: </p>
    <h2>Vector design</h2>
    <p>I had recently started to use Adobe Illustrator to make vectors.</p>
    <p>To be very clear this is something I just do for fun as a hobby but not something I'm actually perfecting as a career.</p>
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h4>Penguin</h4>
    <img src="../assets/images/penguin.png" alt="A penguin standing up" height="250"/>
    <p>As much as I would love to say that this is my own work, it's not. As I had said i had just recently started using Illustrator.The penguin above is from a tutorial on using Illustrator by Dan Scott at Evanto which was a nice begginer friendly tutorial.</p>
    <h4>Icons</h4>
    <img src="../assets/images/icons.png" alt="A bunch of icons" height="250"/>
    <p>Those colourful icons are also something I made from the tutorial</p>
    <h4>Sea life</h4>
    <img src="../assets/images/sea_life.png" alt="A crab and a starfish" height="250"/>
    <p>Now this was my work, I had put some effort on the starfish but not so much on the crab. But I did try and hope to improve my skills.</p>
    <h4>Sharp letters</h4>
    <img src="../assets/images/sharp_logos.png" alt="A capital A and N" height="250"/>
    <p>This is somehow my work, I watched the tutorial and made something different with the skills used</p>

    <p>A huge thank you and appreciation to Dan Scott for such amazing and beginner friendly courses of his.</p>
